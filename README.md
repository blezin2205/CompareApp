# CompareApp
I created an App, where cards are compared to show the user if they match or not. I used Firebase as database for my list of questions for cards and SwiftUI framework. I also used mvvm architecture. For card view I implemented height dependencies by text. For example, I set the height of all cells on the basis of the highest cell.
